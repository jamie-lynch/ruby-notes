# Ruby Notes

This project contains a series of notes and snippets that I've collected as I learn Ruby. 
For now they all exist unorganised in the README but at some point I'll probably organise them a bit better. 

## Contents

- [Type Conversions](#type-conversions)
- [Class Reopening](#class-reopening)
- [Refinements](#refinements)
- [`__FILE__ == $0`](#__file__--0)
= [Constants vs Variables](#constants-vs-variables)
- [Lots of things are methods](#lots-of-things-are-methods)
- [Punctuation Convention](#punctuation-conventions)

## Type Conversions

Ruby has got most of the methods you'd expect for type conversions, e.g.

```ruby
1.to_s
# "1"

"1".to_i
# 1

{foo: "bar", hello: "world"}.to_a
# [[:foo, "bar"], [:hello, "world"]]

[[:foo, "bar"], [:hello, "world"]].to_h
# {:foo=>"bar", :hello=>"world"}

"hello".to_sym
# :hello
```

The main gotcha to be aware of is with using `to_i` as this has odd behaviour for values that cannot be directly converted.

```ruby
1.5.to_i
# 1

"hello".to_i
# 0
```

Instead use `Integer(val)` which will throw and exception if the value cannot be converted

## Class Reopening

Class reopening (a.k.a Monkey Patching) can be used to add new methods or override existing methods on classes after they have been defined. 

```ruby
class Dog
  def talk
    puts "woof"
  end
end

dog = new Dog
dog.talk
# woof

class Dog
  def fetch
    :bone
  end
end

dog1 = new Dog
dog.talk
# woof
dog.fetch
# :bone
```

This can be useful in some situations but also confusing as that instance will retain those patches wherever it is passed around. 

An example of this in the wild is the `active_record/serialization` library which adds methods to built in classes. 

```ruby
[1,2,3].to_json
# NoMethodError (undefined method `to_json' for [1, 2, 3]:Array)

require "active_record/serialization"

[1,2,3].to_json
# "[1,2,3]"
```

## Refinements

Refinements offer similar functionality to [Class Reopening](#class-reopening) but with limited scope. This is useful to be able to make use of the power of class reopening without polluting the global signature of a class. Refinements are only active in the current scope after calling `using`. This means that they won't be active outside the file where it is loaded in, or when an instance of the class is passed outside of the file. 

```ruby
class Dog
  def bark
    puts "woof"
  end
end

module DogFetch
  refine Dog do
    def fetch
      :bone
    end
  end
end

dog1 = Dog.new
dog1.fetch
# NoMethodError (undefined method `fetch' for #<Dog:0x00007f7c1e2851d0>)

using DogFetch

dog2 = Dog.new
dog2.fetch
# :bone
```

## `__FILE__ == $0`

`__FILE__` is a magic variable which refers to the name of the current file. `$0` is a variable that refers to the name of the file used to launch the program. A common use case for this is to conditionally run some code if the current file is the one used to start the program.

The following example defines a `Dog` class which may be imported and used by other the parts of the application. If the file is run directly, however, a new `Dog` would be instantiated and the `bark` method called.

```ruby
# dog.rb
class Dog
  def bark
    puts "woof"
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  dog = Dog.new
  dog.bark
end

# person.rb
require_relative "dog"

class Person
  def initialize(has_pet = true)
    if has_pet
      @pet = Dog.new
    end
  end

  def pet
    @pet
  end
end

p = Person.new
p.pet.bark
# woof

# terminal
# $ ruby dog.rb
# "woof"
```

## Constants vs Variables

Constants and variables are differentiated by the case of the first character. 

```ruby
my_variable = "hello"
puts my_variable # hello
my_variable = "world"
puts my_variable # world

MY_CONSTANT = "hello"
puts MY_CONSTANT # hello
MY_CONSTANT = "world"
# 2: warning: already initialized constant B
# 1: warning: previous definition of B was here
```

## Lots of things are methods

A lot of the standard operations are methods in Ruby. For example, checking if two things are equal or accessing an item in a list.

```ruby
puts 1 == 1 # true
puts 1.==(1) # true
```

```ruby
my_hash = {
  :hello => "world"
}

puts my_hash[:hello] # world
puts my_hash.[](:hello) # world
```

This also means that we can implement that functionality for custom classes by implementing those methods. 

```ruby
class ListWithDefault
  def initialize(items, default)
    @items = items
    @default = default
  end

  def [](index)
    if index > @items.size - 1
      @default
    else
      @items[index]
    end
  end
end

list = ListWithDefault::new([1,2,3], 42)
puts list[0] # 1
puts list[4] #Â 42
```

## Punctuation Conventions

Methods names may end in `!`, `?` or `=`. By convention this means:

### `!`

The method modifies the receiver. Generally there will also be a non-bang method that returns the modified value and leaves the original as is.

```ruby
a = "test"

a.upcase # "TEST"
puts a # "test"

a.upcase! # "TEST"
puts a # "TEST"
```

In some cases, `!` may also represent that the method will throw and error if a problem occurs. 

### `?`

These methods return a truthy or falsly. This is often `true` or `false` but may also be an object that indicates truthy.

```ruby
a = "test"

a.start_with? "t" # true
```

### `=`

The `=` indicates an assignment method. This might be a method created by `attr_writer` or a custom implementation (for example, for an indirect setter).

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  def full_name
    @first_name + " " + @last_name
  end

  def full_name=(name)
    @first_name, @last_name = name.split(" ")
  end
end

p1 = Person.new
p1.first_name= "John"
p1.last_name= "Smith"
puts p1.full_name # "John Smith"

p2 = Person.new
p2.full_name= "Jane Doe"
puts p2.first_name # "Jane"
puts p2.last_name # "Doe"
```
